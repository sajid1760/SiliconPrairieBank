Web App interface for a machine learning loan approval app

http://sajid17602.pythonanywhere.com/

This project is about creating a web application to build a machine learning model that allows a user to input data about themselves into a form, transform the data and feed it into a machine learning model in Python, and send the results back to the website. The purpose of the model is to decide whether an applicant is approved for a credit card or approved for a loan.

The website was built on a Flask Server in Python and deployed on pythonanywhere.com. You may explore the website using the above link.

The website also has links to five Tableau Dashboards that display the data from the datasets in interesting ways. The user is encouraged to use these dashboards to find interesting patterns in the datasets.
